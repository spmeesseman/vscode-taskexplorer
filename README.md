## Description <!-- omit in toc -->

Provides a view in either (or both) the SideBar and/or Explorer that displays all supported tasks organized into a treeview, with parent task file nodes, grouped nodes, and project folders (convenient for large multi-root workspaces).  Tasks can be opened for view/edit, executed, and stopped, among other things for specific task types, for example NPM file nodes support common npm command(s) (i.e. 'install') via context menu.

## Configuring Global Excludes and Apache Ant Includes

The setting *exclude* defines a file/directory pattern or an array of file/directory patterns to ignore using *Glob Patterns* or a valid *File URI*.  The setting applies to all script types.  For example:

* `taskExplorer.exclude: [ "**/.vscode-test/**", "**/vendor/**", "**/out/**", "**/output/**", "/c:/projects/project1/src/theme/test/package.json" ]`

Note that the glob pattern "\*\*/node_modules/\*\*" is applied by default to the excludes list in all cases.  Using the *exclude* configuration can greatly improve performance in large workspaces if configured correctly.

Task files that are found by Task Expolorer can also be added to the *excludes* list via the tree node context menu, by right clicking the task file or task group node, and selecting *Add to Excludes*.

**Apache Ant** uses an .xml file extension, the setting *includeAnt* can be used to specify other file names other than [Bb]uild.xml to include as ant files so that all xml files do not need to be searched (slowing down tree refreshes in large workspaces or project with a large number of various xml files).  The setting defines a file pattern or an array of file patterns to include using *Glob Patterns* or a valid *File URI*, for example:

* `taskExplorer.includeAnt: [ "**/extraTasks.xml", "**/scripts/ant/*.xml", "/c:/projects/project1/scripts/test/antetests.xml" ]`

Note that the glob pattern "\*\*/[Bb]uild.xml" is applied by default to the **Ant** includes list in all cases.  If you don't include the asterisked glob pattern `**/` first in the string, files in sub-folders will not be found.

## Ant and Gulp Self Provided Tasks

By default, a custom parser is used to locate Ant and Gulp tasks in respective files.  This may be fine in most cases, but in cases where the script and/or build files become complex, or there is something in the file that was not coded into the parser, you can use the *ant* and *gulp* programs themseleves to find their own tasks.  Note however that turning this on has a negative performance impact when refreshing and providing tasks to the VSCode Task Host.

## Using Groups With A Separator

**EXPERIMENTAL**
The *Groups With Separator* option is simply an extra level of task groupings that can be made based on a configured separation character in the script name.  This option can be turned on/off with the *Group With Sepator* option in Settings, the default is OFF. The default separator is a dash ("-").

For example, consider 10 npm tasks, 5 of which all start with the string *dev-*, 5 of which start with the string *prod-*.  Prior to Version 1.23, this would create 10 individual task nodes within the main npm task node in the task tree:

    npm
        dev-build
        dev-build-server
        dev-build-themes
        dev-cp-from-bin
        dev-clean
        prod-build
        prod-build-server
        prod-build-themes
        prod-cp-from-bin
        prod-clean

By enabling the *Group With Sepator* option in Settings and setting the *Group Sepator* to a dash ("-") two new grouped nodes would be created underneath the main npm node, one called *dev* and the other called *prod*.  Each of these two sub-nodes of course would contain the respective *dev-* and *prod-* scrtips/tasks, minus the prepended group name:

    npm
        dev
            build
            build-server
            build-themes
            cp-from-bin
            clean
        prod
            build
            build-server
            build-themes
            cp-from-bin
            clean

## Internally Provided Tasks vs. VSCode Provided Tasks

The following tasks are provided by VSCode:

* Workspace (.vscode/tasks.json)
* NPM (**/package.json)

All other tasks are internaly provided.  Workspace tasks are detected by VSCode in all cases.  However, NPM tasks are detected only if the setting `'Npm -> Auto Detect'` is turned on in VSCode Settings.  By default this is turned on, but if NPM tasks are not displaying, please check this setting, also check the setting that turns npm package management off in favor of Yarn `'Npm -> Package manager'`.  A future release will contain internally provided NPM and Yarn tasks.  Note these tasks are still displayed in the Task Tree, just not "provided" by this extension.

Detection of all internally provided task types can be turned on/off in Settings - `'Task Explorer -> Enable [Tasktype]'`.

## Running bash/sh scripts in Windows Environment

Bash/sh scripts in Windows will have the shell executable automatically set to a bash shell (if the default shell set in VSCode is not bash).  The shell executable used can be set in Settings using the `pathToBash` setting.  If there is no value set in Settings, and Git Bash exists at the default installation installation, Git Bash will be used (MinGW).  If Git Bash does not exist at the default install location, it is assumed the the path to bash.exe is part of the system PATH variable.  If you experience errors running Bash scripts in Windows, please check these items.

## Development Notes

3/25/20 - CI has to be THE most overrated tech on the planet.  CI should be named PA standing for "pain in the ass".  These are personal notes for correcting CI issues that happen seemingly every other release.

When semantic release kindly creates the git version tag, then something bombs, run the following git commands to remove the git tag, remote and local:

    git push origin :v1.26.1
    git tag --delete v1.26.1

Babel runtime:

Errors in reelase when incuding babel runtime:

This extension consists of 379 files, out of which 230 are JavaScript files. For performance reasons, you should bundle your extension. You should also exclude unnecessary files by adding them to your .vscodeignore.

WHen messing with babel, and finishing, install/uninstall the runtime:

    npm install @bebel/runtime
