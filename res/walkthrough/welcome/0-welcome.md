## Version 3.0 Preview Release

After a long pause due to the loss of my beloved daughter, development has continued and Version 3 is ready for preview.  TO install the v3 preview releases, ensure the `Preview` ption is enabled in the Extensions View description

## Description

Provides a view in either (or both) the SideBar and/or Explorer that displays all supported tasks organized into a treeview, with parent task file nodes, grouped nodes, and project folders (convenient for large multi-root workspaces).  Tasks can be opened for view/edit, executed, and stopped, among other things for specific task types, for example NPM file nodes support common npm command(s) (i.e. 'install') via context menu.
